"""Shared utilities and core types used across CapyMOA."""

# `_instance` must be imported before `io`/`moa`/`torch`: those submodules
# (transitively) import names from `capymoa.core`, which requires this
# module's own `_instance` re-exports to already be bound. isort would
# normally alphabetize `from . import ...` above `from ._instance import
# ...`, which reintroduces that circular import, hence `isort: skip`.
